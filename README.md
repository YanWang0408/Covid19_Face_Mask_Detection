# Covid19_Face_Mask_Detection


> :memo: This is a very basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras library and OpenCV to detect if you are wearing a face mask. 


### Data Source: 
1. Flickr-Faces-HQ3 (FFHQ), FFHQ contains 70000 high-quality images of human faces in PNG images at 1024 × 1024 resolution and is free of use. The FFHQ dataset offers a lot of variety in terms of age, ethnicity, viewpoint, lighting, and image background. https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset. 

2. MaskedFace-Net - a dataset of human faces with a correctly or incorrectly worn mask (137,016 images) based on the FFHQ,  by Adnane Cabani, Karim Hammoudi, Halim Benhabiles, and Mahmoud Melkemi. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08016.pdf.

### Codes: 

#### Step 1: Training Mask Detector 



#### Step 2: Realtime Mask Detection
